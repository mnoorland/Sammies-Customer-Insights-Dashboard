# Power BI Dashboard for Customer Insights – Sammies B.V.

## Project Overview
During my internship at Sammies B.V., I developed a Power BI dashboard to gain better insights into customer expectations and preferences regarding shipping and returns. The dashboard was based on the results of a customer survey and visualized key insights such as demographics, shipping preferences, packaging preferences, and product offerings. These insights helped the company’s business development team make informed decisions to improve logistics and customer service strategies.

## Objectives
- **Analyze customer expectations** for shipping, returns, and packaging.
- **Visualize survey results** to identify trends and key areas for improvement.
- **Support decision-making** by providing data-driven insights to the business development team.

## Key Features
- **Demographics Analysis:** Visualized customer demographics to understand key segments.
- **Shipping Preferences:** Identified customer preferences regarding shipping methods, delivery times, and costs.
- **Packaging Preferences:** Analyzed customer opinions on packaging, including sustainability preferences.
- **Product Offerings:** Provided insights into customer feedback on product offerings and potential areas for improvement.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Used to create the dashboard and visualize the survey results.
- **Excel**: Utilized to preprocess the survey data before importing it into Power BI.
